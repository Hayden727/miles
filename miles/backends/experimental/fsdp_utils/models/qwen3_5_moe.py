"""GatedDeltaNet packed-sequence fix for the FSDP backend (explicit cu_seqlens threading).

The FSDP backend packs multiple (prompt+response) documents into one forward
(``--use-dynamic-batch-size``). Softmax-attention layers handle this via varlen
flash-attn + position_ids, but the stock-HF GatedDeltaNet runs its TWO stateful ops
over the whole packed row without any sequence boundaries:

  * the linear-attention recurrence (fla ``chunk_gated_delta_rule`` / ``fused_recurrent_*``), and
  * the ``causal_conv1d`` short convolution.

Both bleed across document boundaries, so every token after the first packed document
gets a wrong hidden state -> the train/rollout logprob abs-diff inflates from ~0.015 to
~0.07. (Megatron passes cu_seqlens to its GDN and stays ~0.02; the SGLang rollout runs
each sequence separately, so it has no bleed -- the FSDP train side is the odd one out.)

Fix (explicit, no global/thread-local state): the decoder-layer forward already receives
the packed ``position_ids``; it derives ``cu_seqlens`` (recurrence) and ``seq_idx`` (conv)
from them (the shared ``packed_seq_context`` derivation) and stashes them on its own
GatedDeltaNet submodule. The GatedDeltaNet forward then injects them into the fla /
causal_conv1d kernels so both states reset per document. Both run inside the
gradient-checkpointed decoder layer, so the boundaries are recomputed identically on the
backward pass (setting them at the outer model forward would break activation
checkpointing, since that forward is not re-run during recomputation).

This only affects the THD packing case (batch==1, >1 document) of GatedDeltaNet models;
every other shape / model is left untouched.
